### 👋 Hi! I'm Alex
You can usually find me on social media using the *AlexTECPlayz* username or tag.\
I'm a game, software, and web developer, mainly targeting Linux and Web, and Android (exclusively for games).

- 🇷🇴 Living in Romania
- 🙋‍♂️ Pronouns: she/her, they/them | 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️ I'm Trans, Bi, Aro, Non-Binary
- 🚧 Currently working on a few hobby projects
- 💼 **I'm available for work!** | Check out my [Portfolio](https://alextecplayz.com/portfolio) and my [CV](https://alextecplayz.com/cv). Looking for positions in web development or customer service, not available for freelance work.

### ⚙️ Tech Stack
The bulk of the code editing is done in VSCodium and GNOME Text Editor (based on gedit). Nowadays I exclusively work in C++, GDScript and JavaScript. I have some knowledge of Kotlin, Java, C#, but I have no plans to work again in these languages at this time.

For game development, I use Sapphire Engine ([my proprietary fork of Godot](https://alextecplayz.com/post/roadmap/2024/01/13/Sapphire-thread.html)). I code in C++ (engine, games) and GDScript.

I used Unreal Engine versions 4 through 5 from 2019, but I dropped it entirely at the end of 2024 (reasons outlined in my article linked above).

I (*very* rarely) use Android Studio to occasionally test out new features of the Android API, but I am not working on developing native Android apps anymore.

For my (occasional) art, I use MagicaVoxel (for voxel-based art), Blender (for 3D art), and Aseprite (for 2D art).

### 📧 Contact, Social Media
I prefer to be contacted primarily on [Mastodon](https://techhub.social/@alextecplayz). If you don't have an account on the Fediverse, you should. Another way to reach me is via [e-mail](mailto:alextec70@protonmail.com). Do not contact me on other platforms if we're not already friends, I will not respond.

Regarding some platforms like reddit, Discord, Twitter - I will NOT respond. I haven't used these platforms in over a year, and I do not plan on using them again. My account will remain there to prevent impersonation.
